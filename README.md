**Tux the commander** is a 2D plateform game based on the concept of war,  where the player embodies the role of the main character to save his friends from the hands of the enemy clan. The game is inspired by linux mascot **Tux** who plays the main role of a commander who finds himself in the duty to protect his community against enemies who covet their territory. The game starts exactly at the point where the main character realizes that his friends were kidnapped by the enemy, so he goes to save them.

## Game concept
### Synopsis
Due to the global warming to which the world is exposed today, animals of the North Pole live in perpetual fear. Penguins occupy the most secure region of the north pole against global warming, therefore many other species covet their territories. Since penguins cannot share their restricted territory, they started creating machines that generate ice and distribute it to other species. 

Unfortunately, some species of the north pole were not satisfied, and now they covet not only the territory of the penguins, but also the manufacturing plan of the technological tools which  generates ice, for profit and wealth.
### Local
Nowadays, animals of the North Pole are struggling to find a safe place to live and to escape global warming.

## Game mechanics
### Gameplay

The player embodies the character of tux, the commander, who must find and rescue penguins held hostage by enemies.
The main goal of the game is to move forward by constantly shooting enemies with an ice machine gun which turns them into a block of ice, and to avoid their shots, there will be other scenes where there are fewer enemies but a little more traps and puzzles to solve.
 
The game actually consists of more than one level. However, the number of levels has not been determined yet. In all levels, the mission will be the same as in first level, getting from point A to point B without getting killed by enemies,  at the end of each level, tux must face a boss, and rescue one of his companions. The only difference will be the locations.
 
The player plays these levels from a first person viewed from a side-view camera angle. The player controls the main character named Tux, who is one of the commanders in the penguin army. The abilities of our character as a player are walking, running, sliding, jumping in on side direction, using-reloading-changing weapons, and collecting the pick- ups.
